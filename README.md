# EM_Monitoring_System

Electron Microscope monitoring system using prometheus

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/EM-Monitoring-System>
:---:           | :---:
Releases        | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/EM-Monitoring-System/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from EM_Monitoring_System import __version__

print(f"Hello EM_Monitoring_System {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m EM_Monitoring_System --version
```
